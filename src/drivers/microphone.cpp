 * Microphone Driver Design Requirements and Implementation Notes
 ******************************************************************************/

/*
 * Audio Sampling
 * --------------
 * - The microphone must capture audio at a fixed sample rate of 44.1 kHz.
 * - Each FFT processing cycle requires a buffer of 1024 audio samples.
 * - The audio samples must be converted and stored in Q15 fixed-point format.
 */

/*
 * Buffering and Timing
 * --------------------
 * - Implement a circular buffer to continuously capture microphone input.
 * - After every 1024 new samples, trigger an FFT processing task.
 * - This trigger can be implemented using DMA complete interrupt or timer ISR.
 */

/*
 * Preprocessing
 * -------------
 * - Before applying FFT, apply a Hanning window to the 1024-sample frame.
 * - Use Q15 arithmetic for the window function to maintain consistency.
 * - The Hanning coefficients must also be represented in Q15 format.
 */

/*
 * FFT Processing
 * --------------
 * - Use ARM CMSIS-DSP real FFT functions for fast and efficient processing.
 * - Functions to use:
 *     - arm_rfft_q15() for performing the real FFT
 *     - arm_cmplx_mag_squared_q15() to compute magnitude squared (energy)
 * - Be cautious with scaling to avoid overflow in Q15 arithmetic.
 */

/*
 * Fixed-Point Arithmetic
 * ----------------------
 * - Q15 format is required for FFT input/output and windowing.
 * - For intermediate calculations, especially if additional headroom is needed,
 *   Q31 format may be used.
 * - Floating-point operations are prohibited due to hardware limitations on RP2040.
